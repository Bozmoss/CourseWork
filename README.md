#OpenGL Real-TIme Raytracing

For my project, I am going to make a 3D raytracing engine, taking some inspiration from how blender deals with their rendering. When this project is completed, I want to have a 3D simulated environment in which objects can be added and different material properties of the object can be changed in real time, with some physics as well.
